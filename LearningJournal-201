# 3/6/17 #

Today was the first day of CodeFellows 201. The teacher is cool, lively, blunt, and quick. I like that. It was nice to have a few familiar bits and a few (ok, a lot) of new bits. I LOVE terminal because it is so efficient. Git is a little confusing.

I learned a bit more about using terminal. I also felt like I was prepared for class. I did the work, read the pages, and showed up.


What destroyed me was (feeling like) being left alone with the assignment. JavaScript, though I took the Codecademy course a few weeks ago, totally escaped me. My mind went blank! I looked around the room and everyone was quietly typing away. That didn't help. I was mentally freaking out and decided to get out of the room. I found the other half of the class working away, though more in community. People were helping each other, talking, laughing, supporting. This was a better pace for me.

We had to make a prompt in JavaScript and went all the way to fun reasons, scoured the web, thought I was cheating and started sweating. Once again I was making things harder than they need to be. I remembered reading somewhere if you are struggling for more than 15 minutes to ask for help. 18 min later, I asked a TA for help and came back to earth. This is an excerpt of the result:

<p>Where are you from?
  <script> var born = prompt("where were you born?");
  alert(born + ' is a great place!');
  console.log(name + ' was born in'+ born);
  </script>
</p>

... and it **WORKED**!!!!  It was great to help out another classmate as well, and find out that I was in the same boat as everyone else.

My goals are to stay focused, keep trying and ask for help.

Journal time. Today wasn't as maddening. Even though I needed a lot of help, I jumped in and attacked the assignment. Yeah, it was wrong, but I worked it out, asked for help, and fixed it.

I noticed a few things today. I noticed that when I ask questions in class, the rest of the class starts asking questions.  I think a lot of people are afraid of looking dumb. However, I also things they appreciate it when I ask questions.

GitHub is maddening, though it irritates everyone so I don't feel so bad.

Other than all this, I'll add a few list stuffs for the assignment. So I learned these cool things:

1. it's pretty easy to tally stuff.
  *declare the variable to count: var correct = 0;
  *set it to count correct++;
  *say the counted/tally cuz why else count anything: alert('Awesome, ' + name + '! You got ' + correct + ' out of 7 questions correct!');

2. Ask questions relentlessly. I noticed my self say "I'm sorry, but [question]" and it pissed me off. That dumb thing women do, apologizing for not knowing, speaking up, existing. Bleh. I'm here to learn.

3. I screwed up for loops so well that I think I get them. I like to throw some code up and work it out.

My goal now is to write code and work it out. I want to get in the habit of doing that.



Cheers.

Today rocked. I loved the assignment, the vibe is great on Fridays at CF, and the team is getting to know each other some more. I have to say I am kinda bummed I won't go into 301 with my class because I need to take April off as my family is coming to visit. OH well.

#Suggestion#No ones leave until everyone understands and it satisfied with their work.

Today I floated stuff in CSS. It wasn't that hard to align blocks side by side. In fact, it went well. I also go to pair program and I liked it. Here's the code:

ul {
  list-style: none;
  display: inline-block;
}
#top{
  display: inline-block;
}

#company{
  display: inline-block;
}

#menu{
  display: inline-block;
  float: right;
}

#social{
  display: inline-block;
  overflow: hidden;
  /*float: left;*/
  /*padding: 0 20px;*/
}
#socialLogo{
  display: inline;
  float: left;
}

#recipe-name{
  display: inline-block;
}

#container {
  height: 400px;
  width: 400px;
  position: relative;
}
#image {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  top: 0;
}
#text {
  z-index: 100;
  position: absolute;
  font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: bold;
  left: 150px;
  top: 1px;
}

#print{
  display: inline-block;
  float: right;
}

#print-pic{
  display: inline;
  float: left;
}

#image{
  background:

}

#headshot{
  display: inline-block;
}

#author{
  display: inline-block;
  }

#author-info{
  display: inline;
  float: left;
}

#share{
  display: inline-block;
  float: right;
}

Loved today, loved this week. Peace out.

Today I learned, once again, that I am doing ok. I'm not gonna lie, this is kicking my ass, hard. However, I want to learn this stuff and I like it. SO, I'll be back for more. I am hoping I can pull form past lessons to do this class lesson.

I need to work more with the bros. Tomorrow I will collaborate and ask more questions, get help form the team, try to tag team. To be honest that makes the class harder, but I will do it.

I want to be able to sit down and write some for loops, if/else, and object constructions. I want to know this vocabulary better so I can express what I am thinking. I am sick of saying 'that thing'. I still get lost with that stuff. I'll get here.

I don't have much juice left in my battery, so that's what I have for today. I am excited for the week and will do everything I can to tell my ego to step aside.

Damn.

I am tired. This week took it's toll, 14 hour days M-F and then 4-6 hour days on the weekends. This week was hard but great. I figured out a few things that really boosted my moral.  I am anxious for the 301 entrance exam as I feel like I keep asking for help and not really getting JavaScprit. I want to be able to sit down and write a fairly simple function, though that is still a challenge. I want to take 301 and I want to get a job.

I am excited for the project and have always wanted to work with beacon concepts and Google anything. I am also happy about our team. It will be very different to start the project without a detailed assignment. Looking forward it it!

Later,
Amanda

Hola,

Today was great. Why? I got to see some jQuery, non-vanilla js, and Ajax. Holy cannoli, I see now why 201 is so hard. We had to learn Latin to learn Spanish. Ok, that's one way. Today made me very excited about 301. I was thrilled to see non-vanilla js. It made so much more sense. Good times.

Onto project week. I think our project is pretty ambitious though I think we can do it.  I like the idea so that's the first step.  I found a style sheet to work with and that relieves us of a huge amount of css decision making. Huge amount.

I think our team will work well together, though communication is going to be key. I noticed there was a lot of interrupting and not the highest EQ. All dudes on my team (of course) and I have found, with my team as well, that dudes are very lax about planning. I was trying to come up with a plan, assign tasks, and get my teammates to commit to stuff and crap... it felt like lifting an 18 wheeler. I'll watch on that. I have PM'd a lot of digital projects throughout my career in the US and internationally and have found one inaugural sentence works everywhere, "the only way to get shit done is to get shit done." So, I dropped it with these guys and they got it. Overall these are nice people though I do miss my little core team of vets.

This week I learned that understanding the code is key. I may not be able to sit down and crank out perfect code, but I understand it. I am thrilled with my progress and really excited about 301.

Looking forward to tying up loose ends, taking the entrance exam, and doing a little product work. Yay!

Hasta,
Amanda

Project day started today. I learned immediately that UX is my path. I spent several hours over the weekend building out our style guide which was super helpful for the team. We didn't have to think about colors, fonts, color-combos, etc. I love creating wireframes, designed the flow and setting up a plan for the team.  I noticed they wanted to jump in and code, I know how problematic that can be, so I started leading our team by setting up a structure right away that would make building simple. It worked. I created a file naming structure that corresponded to branch names, defined pages vs prompts and designed a workflow that worked. I love doing that stuff. Plus, I know how to code so I am on my way.

I still stared blankly at the screen when it came time for JavaScript and know I really need to practice over April. It's still not natural for me, though I would like it to be.

Overall I am feeling good about project week and my team. I do miss working along side my vets though. I miss working with them.

I will also say I am amazed at how much I have learned over the last 3 weeks. I know I can build this project on my own and wow, that is amazing!

Let's have a party on Friday!!

Peace,
Amanda

Today was hard because of JS. JS kicks my ass every time I am excited for it to get a little easier. But, eventually I got it. I learned that everyone has to debug and troubleshoot, and it felt good to debug with a TA vs. feeling like the TA is doing all the work.

I am still feeling good about the project and the team. Tomorrow I will work a bit on CSS which I love, and finalize the functionality. I will also work on influencing the design of the site because some of what I am seeing looks pretty bad.

It was nice that a classmate came up to me and said "I miss sitting next to you in class." Aw, sweet. I miss my little gang. It does feel like we all went though battle together. I am pretty tired so will en it here.

Peace,
Amanda

Today I learned something neat today on my own but it worked and helped out my team and project. I learned that if there are 2 inputs in 1 div in HTML, there needs to e a main id, and the other is <em>for='that id</em>'. it worked and felt amazing.

Also, I am starting to be able to debug my own issues. I will call the TAs over, we sill sit there together and I will see my mistakes an correct them. Or, at least attempt to. This feels amazing. I may not be the best in the class but I am progressing.  I love project week. I like my team, though still notice a teammate does not make eye contact with me nearly as much as the man on the team but I push through it. It is annoying, as though I am the secretary but oh well.

It is amazing to watch the idea come together, and watch James get very excited about this as it was his idea. I love the teamwork in general.

I will reiterate, Code Fellows has done an extraordinary job in leadership training for the instructors and TAs. Extraordinary. CF is leading from the front and the leadership and EQ skills trickle down to the students. Bravo!

My eyes are falling out of my head.
Amanda
