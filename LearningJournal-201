## 3/6/17 ##

Today was the first day of CodeFellows 201. The teacher is cool, lively, blunt, and quick. I like that. It was nice to have a few familiar bits and a few (ok, a lot) of new bits. I LOVE terminal because it is so efficient. Git is a little confusing.

I learned a bit more about using terminal. I also felt like I was prepared for class. I did the work, read the pages, and showed up.


What destroyed me was 9feeling like) being left alone with the assignment. JavaScript, though I took the Codecademy course a few weeks ago, totally escaped me. My mind went blank! I looked around the room and everyone was quietly typing away. That didn't help. I was mentally freaking out and decided to get out of the room. I found the other half of the class working away, though more in community. People were helping each other, talking, laughing, supporting. This was a better pace for me.

We had to make a prompt in JavaScript and went all the way to fun reasons, scoured the web, thought I was cheating and started sweating. Once again I was making things harder than they need to be. I remembered reading somewhere if you are struggling for more than 15 minutes to ask for help. 18 min later, I asked a TA for help and came back to earth. This is an excerpt of the result:

<p>Where are you from?
  <script> var born = prompt("where were you born?");
  alert(born + ' is a great place!');
  console.log(name + ' was born in'+ born);
  </script>
</p>

... and it **WORKED**!!!!  It was great to help out another classmate as well, and find out that I was in the same boat as everyone else.

My goals are to stay focused, keep trying and ask for help.

Journal time. Today wasn't as maddening. Even though I needed a lot of help, I jumped in and attacked the assignment. Yeah, it was wrong, but I worked it out, asked for help, and fixed it.

I noticed a few things today. I noticed that when I ask questions in class, the rest of the class starts asking questions.  I think a lot of people are afraid of looking dumb. However, I also things they appreciate it when I ask questions.

GitHub is maddening, though it irritates everyone so I don't feel so bad.

Other than all this, I'll add a few list stuffs for the assignment. So I learned these cool things:

1. it's pretty easy to tally stuff.
  *declare the variable to count: var correct = 0;
  *set it to count correct++;
  *say the counted/tally cuz why else count anything: alert('Awesome, ' + name + '! You got ' + correct + ' out of 7 questions correct!');

2. Ask questions relentlessly. I noticed my self say "I'm sorry, but [question]" and it pissed me off. That dumb thing women do, apologizing for not knowing, speaking up, existing. Bleh. I'm here to learn.

3. I screwed up for loops so well that I think I get them. I like to throw some code up and work it out.

My goal now is to write code and work it out. I want to get in the habit of doing that.

That's what I've got for today!

Cheers.

A little late with my Journaling today.  However, after the reading Chapter 3 in the JS textbook this morning I got excited.  I saw a library of methods and that boosted my morale with JS. To be perfectly honest, JS kicks my ass eery day and I freak out if I'll ever get it. But then I find out about 75% of the class is in the same boat.

Today was different. I saw JS's potential and I look forward to using JS in a more creative way. To date we are writing methods for methods sake in order to learn and I am not really seeing the whole picture. however, once I saw all of those methods I could see how useful JS is.

It's getting late and I don't want to be up too late working on this journal, I'd rather be coding. I did learn last week that CSS is fun for me. I look forward to building more stuff.

Later, Amanda

# 3/13/17 #

Well, tonight I am going to go home crying.  I feel like I ask for help with everything can't do anything on my own. I am afraid I am falling behind and since everything moves so fats that every 10 min I fall behind, is like a day. This really sucks.

I did manage to build about 20% of the project before I was stuck for all the rest. I also managed to do git right. However for the rest of it I feel like I am cheating vs. learning. I jus stare at the screen blankly... then just getting answers from the TAs/Teacher.I'm not even able to get to the reading s it is 8:30pm, my commute is 45 min then I go home and read. Just getting answers from the TAs/Teacher.

Today felt horrible.

How code is therapy: good, bad and ugly.

3pm.
I'm not gonna lie. I am feeling miserable and am in tears throughout the day and at home. The gender imbalance it starting to get to me. There is a playful competitiveness to our class but nonetheless less it feel competitive and it sucks to be the slow kid. That's me in 201.

Besides that I am really struggling with the overall pace. Last night I got home at 10:30p. I read till 12am and still didn't complete the reading. Class feels very fast, screens code, browser flash in front of me and I am unable to keep up.

#Suggestion#
Nick, during class can you try to console/browser and code as a split screen vs. overlaying them + toggling between screens? I am trying to understand code and poof, the code is gone and I am looking at a browser forgetting the code entirely. I want to be able to compare code to browser/console during the code review.

6pm.
# Today I learned #
It is very cool how I can use JS to manipulate an HTML file. Even though it is hard I really like the Salmon Cake project. It is amazing how many commands there are for JS and I really want to learn it. I like how the entire package HTML/CSS/JS works together. I think I'll stay here for awhile.

I also did a few things on git and I did it right! Then I followed some advice and that was wrong. So now I know 1. I get it and 2. I am not the online that is getting things wrong.

10:15pm
Hadiya was right. I have a self confidence problem. AND I have been getting lost in my crappy self talk. Agh. How did code end up being a therapy session?

AGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
Me.
