## My adventures learning to code.
### God help me!

# 3/6/17 #

Today was the first day of CodeFellows 201. The teacher is cool, lively, blunt, and quick. I like that. It was nice to have a few familiar bits and a few (ok, a lot) of new bits. I LOVE terminal because it is so efficient. Git is a little confusing.

I learned a bit more about using terminal. I also felt like I was prepared for class. I did the work, read the pages, and showed up.


What destroyed me was 9feeling like) being left alone with the assignment. JavaScript, though I took the Codecademy course a few weeks ago, totally escaped me. My mind went blank! I looked around the room and everyone was quietly typing away. That didn't help. I was mentally freaking out and decided to get out of the room. I found the other half of the class working away, though more in community. People were helping each other, talking, laughing, supporting. This was a better pace for me.

We had to make a prompt in JavaScript and went all the way to fun reasons, scoured the web, thought I was cheating and started sweating. Once again I was making things harder than they need to be. I remembered reading somewhere if you are struggling for more than 15 minutes to ask for help. 18 min later, I asked a TA for help and came back to earth. This is an excerpt of the result:

<p>Where are you from?
  <script> var born = prompt("where were you born?");
  alert(born + ' is a great place!');
  console.log(name + ' was born in'+ born);
  </script>
</p>

... and it **WORKED**!!!!  It was great to help out another classmate as well, and find out that I was in the same boat as everyone else.

My goals are to stay focused, keep trying and ask for help.

Journal time. Today wasn't as maddening. Even though I needed a lot of help, I jumped in and attacked the assignment. Yeah, it was wrong, but I worked it out, asked for help, and fixed it.

I noticed a few things today. I noticed that when I ask questions in class, the rest of the class starts asking questions.  I think a lot of people are afraid of looking dumb. However, I also things they appreciate it when I ask questions.

GitHub is maddening, though it irritates everyone so I don't feel so bad.

Other than all this, I'll add a few list stuffs for the assignment. So I learned these cool things:

1. it's pretty easy to tally stuff.
  *declare the variable to count: var correct = 0;
  *set it to count correct++;
  *say the counted/tally cuz why else count anything: alert('Awesome, ' + name + '! You got ' + correct + ' out of 7 questions correct!');

2. Ask questions relentlessly. I noticed my self say "I'm sorry, but [question]" and it pissed me off. That dumb thing women do, apologizing for not knowing, speaking up, existing. Bleh. I'm here to learn.

3. I screwed up for loops so well that I think I get them. I like to throw some code up and work it out.

My goal now is to write code and work it out. I want to get in the habit of doing that.



Cheers.

Today rocked. I loved the assignment, the vibe is great on Fridays at CF, and the team is getting to know each other some more. I have to say I am kinda bummed I won't go into 301 with my class because I need to take April off as my family is coming to visit. OH well.

#Suggestion#No ones leave until everyone understands and it satisfied with thir work.

Today I floated stuff in CSS. It wasn't that hard to align blocks side by side. In fact, it went well. I also go to pair program and I liked it. Here's the code:

ul {
  list-style: none;
  display: inline-block;
}
#top{
  display: inline-block;
}

#company{
  display: inline-block;
}

#menu{
  display: inline-block;
  float: right;
}

#social{
  display: inline-block;
  overflow: hidden;
  /*float: left;*/
  /*padding: 0 20px;*/
}
#socialLogo{
  display: inline;
  float: left;
}

#recipe-name{
  display: inline-block;
}

#container {
  height: 400px;
  width: 400px;
  position: relative;
}
#image {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  top: 0;
}
#text {
  z-index: 100;
  position: absolute;
  font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: bold;
  left: 150px;
  top: 1px;
}

#print{
  display: inline-block;
  float: right;
}

#print-pic{
  display: inline;
  float: left;
}

#image{
  background:

}

#headshot{
  display: inline-block;
}

#author{
  display: inline-block;
  }

#author-info{
  display: inline;
  float: left;
}

#share{
  display: inline-block;
  float: right;
}

Loved today, loved this week. Peace out.

Today I learned, once again, that I am doing ok. I'm not gonna lie, this is kicking my ass, hard. However, I want to learn this stuff and I like it. SO, I'll be back for more. I am hoping I can pull form past lessons to do this class lesson.

I need to work more with the bros. Tomorrow I will collaborate and ask more questions, get help form the team, try to tag team. To be honest that makes the class harder, but I will do it.

I want to be able to sit down and write some for loops, if/else, and object constructions. I want to know this vocabulary better so I can express what I am thinking. I am sick of saying 'that thing'. I still get lost with that stuff. I'll get here.

I don't have much juice left in my battery, so that's what I have for today. I am excited for the week and will do everything I can to tell my ego to step aside.

Damn.

3-23-17.

I am tired. This week took it's toll, 14 hour days M-F and then 4-6 hour days on the weekends. This week was hard but great. I figured out a few things that really boosted my moral.  I am anxious for the 301 entrance exam as I feel like I keep asking for help and not really getting JavaScprit. I want to be able to sit down and write a fairly simple function, though that is still a challenge. I want to take 301 and I want to get a job.

I am excited for the project and have always wanted to work with beacon concepts and Google anything. I am also happy about our team. It will be very different to start the project without a detailed assignment. Looking forward it it!

Later,
Amanda

Project day started today. I learned immediately that UX is my path. I spent several hours over the weekend building out our style guide which was super helpful for the team. We didn't have to think about colors, fonts, color-combos, etc. I love creating wireframes, designed the flow and setting up a plan for the team.  I noticed they wanted to jump in and code, I know how problematic that can be, so I started leading our team by setting up a structure right away that would make building simple. It worked. I created a file naming structure that corresponded to branch names, defined pages vs prompts and designed a workflow that worked. I love doing that stuff. Plus, I know how to code so I am on my way.

I still stared blankly at the screen when it came time for JavaScript and know I really need to practice over April. It's still not natural for me, though I would like it to be.

Overall I am feeling good about project week and my team. I do miss working along side my vets though. I miss working with them.

I will also say I am amazed at how much I have learned over the last 3 weeks. I know I can build this project on my own and wow, that is amazing!

Let's have a party on Friday!!

Peace,
Amanda
